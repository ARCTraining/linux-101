# Learning Linux

**Welcome** to your virtual machine! This will help you get to grips with some introductory Linux material.

## First command

The very first command you are going to use, down in the terminal, is `cd`: this will bring you to your home directory and let you follow the guidance given in the [tutorial slides here](https://murphyqm.github.io/research-software-dev/intro-to-linux-files/linux101.html#/title-slide).

# After the course

When you've worked through the content given in the presentation, you might want to continue by working through the content for [The Carpentries Unix Shell Intro](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html). In order to follow this course, you'll need to download the data to your codespace.

## Download data

In the directory you want to download the data to (for example, navigate to your home directory with `cd` then execute the following scripts there):

```bash
wget https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip
```

Then unzip the data:

```bash
unzip shell-lesson-data.zip
```
